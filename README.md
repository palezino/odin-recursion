# odin-recursion

Two small assignments that let you practice recursive functions.
The first assignment is to write a function `fibs` which takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the fibonacci sequence. 
The second assignment is to write a function `mergeSort` that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology.
